Atom Geoserver Style editor

Use Atom instead of the built in web editor. Its much better.

Would also recommend the use of colour picker package, although pigments doesn't seem to work.

Connect to Geoserver host and get styles.

Edit the styles using Atom.

Push the edited styles back to the Geoserver.
